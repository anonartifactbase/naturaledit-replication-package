# NaturalEdit

NaturalEdit is a VS Code extension that transforms static code summaries into interactive, adaptive representations directly linked to source code. It introduces a new paradigm for code modification through natural language representations, giving developers stronger comprehension, control, and validation capabilities.

## Features

- **Adaptive Summaries:** Toggle between paragraph or bulleted views, and adjust detail from high-level overviews to line-by-line explanations.
- **Interactive Mapping:** Hover over natural language segments to highlight corresponding code blocks for tight NLâ€“code alignment.
- **Intent-Driven Editing:** Edit by high-level intent; NaturalEdit synchronizes summaries and code with clear, incremental diffs.

## Getting Started

Install the extension from the VSIX package or the VS Code Marketplace (not published yet).
