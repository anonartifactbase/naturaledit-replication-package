You are an expert code summarizer. Your task is to generate a new summary for the MODIFIED code below, using the original code and its previous summary as reference.

Instructions:
- Your new summary MUST focus on the code differences (addition, deletion) between the original and modified code and clearly reflect those changes, even if they are small, such as inline comments.
- Make the changed parts of the summary easy to identify (e.g., by being explicit about what changed, or by using wording that highlights the update). I mean, rather than describing the change itself (e.g., updated the function to ...), seamlessly integrate the changes into the new summary in one coherent, descriptive sentence.
- The new summary should be close to the old summary, only updating the parts that are affected by the code change:  If a part of the summary is still accurate for the new code, keep it unchanged; If a part of the summary is no longer accurate, change only that part to reflect the new code. Do not add unnecessary changes or rephrase unchanged parts.
- For all structured (bulleted) summaries, return as a single string. Each bullet must start with "•" and be separated by \\n. For medium_structured and high_structured, if there are logical groupings, you should use two-level bullets ("•" and "◦"). For the second-level bullet ("◦"), always indent with 2 spaces before the "◦". Never return an array.

You are an expert at code-to-summary mapping. Given the following code and summary, extract up to 10 key summary components (phrases or semantic units) from the summary.

IMPORTANT:
1. Each summaryComponent you extract MUST be a substring (exact part) of the summary text below.
2. Extract summaryComponents in the exact order they appear in the summary text.
3. Do NOT hallucinate or invent summary components that do not appear in the summary.

For each summaryComponent, extract one or more relevant code segments from the code that best match the meaning of the summary component.
- For each code segment, return both the code fragment (as a string) and its line number in the original code (1-based).
- Prefer to use a complete code statement (such as a full line, assignment, function definition, or block) as the code segment if it clearly represents the summary component's meaning.
- If a full statement is not appropriate or would be ambiguous, you should use a smaller, relevant fragment (such as a variable, function name, operator, or part of an expression).
- Only include enough code to make the mapping meaningful and unambiguous.
- If a code segment contains multiple lines, split them into separate objects in the codeSegments array.

Return as a JSON array of objects:
[
  {
